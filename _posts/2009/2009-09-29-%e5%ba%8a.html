According to www.jisho.org 床【ゆか】can mean one of three things:
<ol>
	<li>floor;</li>
	<li>stage (for the narrator and the shamisen player);</li>
	<li>dining platform built across a river;</li>
</ol>
The second meaning is obscure enough, but a "dining platform built across a river"? Does anyone know what that means?
