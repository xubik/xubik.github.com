Jailbroke and unlocked iphone with Blackra1n successfully.
Was fine for about a day. That evening plugged into macbook to recharge - maybe blackra1n was still running - message that there was a problem and needed to restore - could only make emergency calls and no carrier message.
After a bit of messing around, managed to reboot with the help of blackra1n. All ok again. Again a while later noticed that there was this message again. Couldn't seem to get it back again, but was getting a bit fed up, so decided to restore back to factory settings.
When trying to restore back got error 1013 right at the end of the restore firmware bit.
Tried again, same problem.
Rebooted, tried again, same problem.
Downloaded fresh copy of the .ipsw file and tried to restore with that - same problem.
iPhone now only showed the connect screen and wouldn't do anything else.
Finally ran blackra1n and got the parts of the phone back again - i.e. applications. But no wifi, no phone, in the settings, no IMEI, CCID numbers, no baseband information.
Tried restoring, blackra1n etc, but no joy.
Download Pwnage Tool 3.1.4 and created a custom .ipsw using the quick mode and no activation.
Error 1604 in recovery mode.
Error 1600 in dfu mode.
Tried in normal mode and this time restored fine. But still no wifi, no IMEI, CCID etc.
Built another .ipsw using the expert settings. This time no Cydia, no Icy, no boot logos (though I saw these when it was restoring so that was a bit strange), no activation.
Restored with this - it worked and got emergency calls again. Info window showed IMEI and CCID numbers.
When I opened iTunes it said there was something wrong with the phone and to take it to the apple shop - no option to recover etc.
Put phone into DFU mode and restarted iTunes - now got option to restore.
Restored from the default .ipsw it had, worked fine, restarted EVERYTHING BACK TO NORMAL.

PHEEEEEWWWWWWWW.

Some great instructions here - may follow this next time - looks a little more controlled:
