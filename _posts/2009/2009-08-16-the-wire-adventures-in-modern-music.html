Wanted to get another one, can't remember the name now, but all the CDs were missing (which convinced me the CDs were desirable, so now I really want it). Also discovered after planning my whole shopping route round it that the Borders in Oxford Street no longer exists. Bought <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Long-player-Goodbye-Album-Vinyl-Again/dp/0340934115/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1250423746&amp;sr=1-1">a book</a> at <a title="Foyles" href="http://www.foyles.co.uk" target="_self">Foyles</a> to help make sure it doesn't go the same way.
