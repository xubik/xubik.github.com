Two great articles about the growing use and abuse of punctuation in texts and emails:
<blockquote>Before the 1970s, few manual typewriters were equipped with an exclamation mark key. Instead, if you wanted to express your unbridled joy at - ooh, I don't know - the budding loveliness of an early spring morning and gild the lily of your purple prose with an upbeat startler, you would have to type a full stop, then back space, push the shift key and type an apostrophe. Which is enough to take the joie de vivre out of anyone's literary style.</blockquote>

<blockquote>What happened to "Dear Sir", "Yours faithfully" and the bracing pleasures of a firm handshake? I ask. They died, you reply, but nobody bothered to tell you, granddad.</blockquote>
