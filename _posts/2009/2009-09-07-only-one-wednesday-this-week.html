Good news for people with days of the week pants. Don't have any? Search no more:
<blockquote>Emily Strange Seven Days a Week Pants - Choose from - Mundane Monday - 2s Day - Whens Day Whens Night - Thursdazes - Friday The 13th - Saturday Night - Sundays Best .Emily is 13 years old and wicked bad.Bad meaning good. She has a Posse of 4 cats: Miles, Sabbath, NeeChee, and Mystery. Shes downright strange and knows it. Shes anticool, a subculture of one. Emily isnt evil, shes just up to no good. While those around her may find Emily a bit frightening, or an unpredictable troublemaker, Emilys not really that hard to understand. She may happily put a firecracker in your tailpipe, but brother, you deserved it.</blockquote>
