There are 3 settings you need to change in Firefox in order to get Firefox to work with Windows authentication.

In the address bar, type about:config

Find the following 3 properties:
<ul>
	<li>network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris</li>
	<li>network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris</li>
	<li>network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris</li>
</ul>
You need to add the server you wish to authenticate to the end of the value associated with the property, so it should read something like “localhost, myserver.com”.
