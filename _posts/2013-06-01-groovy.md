#Notes

Use .getClass() after any variable to print the class.

Define lists and maps e.g. `list = []`, `map = [:]`

You can either use dot notation or square brackets notation to reference the keys to get the values e.g. `map.Key1` or `map["Key1"]`

##Closures

These are blocks of code which can be passed around in variables and passed to certain methods.

By default they take one variable called it.

    square = { it * it }
    println square(9)

    [0,1,2,3].collect(square)
	
will perform the function square on each member of the list and return a new array
