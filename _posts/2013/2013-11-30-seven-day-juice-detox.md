## Day 1

Suddenly decided yesterday looking at the rebounder that I had bought and the juicer and now had no excuse not to follow through with the 7 day juice detox. Especially since I still had a heap of fruit from last week. So I started this morning. The extra week I have since Mai delayed one week. 

I had a hot water and hung out the washing from the machine, then did the 15 minutes on the rebounder before making the first juice. Successfully bought a lightening deal vacuum cleaner on Amazon and walked into Greenwich to stock up on more fruit and veg with an idea to go and have a tea at Costa's or Waterstone's. The shopping was really heavy, so walked back, had the second juice, then out again to Waterstone's. Had a herbal tea and read the paper before going back home.

The day was quite hard work mentally, physically really not that bad. Felt a bit full of juice at times, full of apples, and empty of anything else. But it did feel like a total waste of a day. Where is the fun in a day if you can't enjoy a coffee and pastry and later on a chicken salad? 
But the whole point is to reboot and detox my body. And challenge myself to achieve something that requires some will.

One day down, six to go. The sooner you start the sooner its over.

## Day 2

Got up at 10. That helped. Felt fine this morning, particularly when I woke up at 7:30am to go to the toilet. Weighed myself, was 55.5kg, 0.3kg down from yesterday. Did a rebounder session, walked into Greenwich again, a replay of yesterday by and large (boring, but I know how it works). To Waitrose to top up on veg, then to Waterstones for a peppermint tea. Walked home and had the second juice before preparing to go to the cinema, changed into jeans, shirt, nice coat, fast walked up the road, but had the timings wrong for the film. Ended up walking back via the Maritime Museum. Was feeling really good. Got home about 4:30, but had'nt had nearly enough juices, so started feeling a bit hungry. I've ended up drinking one less than the total amount, same as yesterday.

I feel a bit weak and tired now. I don't really feel nice and empty like I have on some diets before on the second day, but maybe that is because I wasn't as overweight and bloated when I started. Hope this works and Mai appreciates it!

## Day 3

On Monday I had to go to work, I got up, made all juices and decided to cycle since the temperature was a balmy 9 degrees. Most of the day I felt quite weak, couldn't really think and in the afternoon started to feel a bit fluey. By the time I'd cycled back home I couldn't decide if I was coming down with something, and thought it best to have something solid to eat, so had half an avocado, then some coleslaw and cold cooked salmon from M&S. Felt much better. 3 days detox this time. Next time 7.
