Philosophy as I have so far understood and lived it
Means living voluntarily among ice and high mountains
Seeking out everything strange and questionable in existence
Everything so far placed under a ban by morality
The ice is near
The solitude tremendous
By how serenely all things lie in the light
How freely one breathes
How much one feels lies beneath oneself

> None of these laggards, however, could touch Friedrich Nietzsche, who held that “all truly great thoughts are conceived by walking.” Rising at dawn, Nietzsche would stalk through the countryside till 11 a.m. Then, after a short break, he would set out on a two-hour hike through the forest to Lake Sils. After lunch he was off again, parasol in hand, returning home at four or five o’clock, to commence the day’s writing.
