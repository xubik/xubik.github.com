Ok, so there are two IP addresses. One of the host server, and one of the VPS. The ssh details I was given in the welcome email don't seem to work. This was the IP address of my VPS, along with the server name of the VPS and the root password. But no username, only a username for the control panel.

I can, however, successfully log in using the console widget with the username provided there, console-something, and ssh in by using the IP address of the host, and the same login details.

But how do I ssh in using the IP address of my actual vps?
