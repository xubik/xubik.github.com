For those of us who think there are four food groups...salt, sugar, grease and beer...who believe there is no food ketchup can't improve...who believe that "vegetarian" means "taste-free" which it does...here's a Forgotten NY tribute to the remaining chrome-plated, cholesterol-jammed eateries scattered around town. Whoever said eating is supposed to be healthy? You eat what tastes good. And, you can't eat in more style than in imitation railroad cars. We're gonna make the cardiologists plenty of $$$$....
